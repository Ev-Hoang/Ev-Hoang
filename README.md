## About me 
I'm a third-year Electronics & Telecommunications student at VNU-UET.  

Currently interning at FPT Telecom, focusing on Python backend (FastAPI), CI/CD with GitLab, and working with PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB.  

I also work on embedded projects using STM32, real-time control, and hardware-level programming.  

In my free time, I code games and practice algorithms on LeetCode to challenge myself and improve problem-solving skills.
